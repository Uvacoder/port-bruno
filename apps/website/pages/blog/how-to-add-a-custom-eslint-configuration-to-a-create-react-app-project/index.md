# How to add a custom ESLint configuration to a Create React AppÂ project

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*j32lk541VB7qNNWbmUd-dQ@2x.png)

### Background

Every front-end project should have some sort of static code analyzing tool. This will ensure that your team sticks to one coding style and avoids known anti-patterns in development.

Arguably, one of the best lint tools for JavaScript projects is [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). It supports a variety of plugins to extend the functionality and has rich east-to-use documentation. ESLint can also be configured to work with TypeScript projects hence previously dominated [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) was deprecated in favor of ESLint.

In this post, we will look at ESLint integration on both JavaScript and TypeScript based React Projects created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) boilerplate.

**Do I need a custom ESLint configuration?**

Probably not. Because Create React App comes with ESLint already integrated. They use their own [sharable ESLint configuration](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/v4.0.3/packages/eslint-config-react-app) and this can be found under the **eslintConfig** object in `package.json`.

```js
 "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
```

If you are fine with using the configuration provided in the boilerplate, you can skip reading now ðŸ™ƒ.

**Why use a custom configuration?**

Mind you that most of the ESLint rules are tailored for a specific individual or team. For example, using _single quotes_ over _double quotes_ will depend on preference.

It is always better to define your own lining rules based on your/teamâ€™s preference if you are working on a long-term project.
